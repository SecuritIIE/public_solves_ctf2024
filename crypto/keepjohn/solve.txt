First get the hash of the database password:
keepass2john Datab.kdbx > Keepasshash.txt


Then crack it with rockyou and the option --rules:
john Keepasshash.txt --format=Keepass --wordlist=rockyoutop1000.txt --rules


You get the password "beautiful11" and then you open the database with it:
keepassxc Datab.kdbx

The flag is inside :)

Hint 1 : John The Ripper can crack hashes of weak password and even recover hashes of password of some databases for instances. 
You can install john with:

---------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/openwall/john

cd john/src

./configure --enable-keepass

make -s 

sudo make install
---------------------------------------------

Hint 2 : Well the password doesn't seems to be in the rockyou file, maybe try some variations of them...
